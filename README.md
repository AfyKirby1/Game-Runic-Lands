## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues
- **Black Screen**: Usually fixed by Phase 3 rendering improvements
- **Grass Not Rendering**: Fixed in Phase 3 - was caused by TerrainType enum mismatch between world generator and renderer
- **No Sound**: Check audio files in `assets/audio/` directory
- **Controls Not Working**: Check `systems/options.py` for keybinding settings
- **Performance Issues**: Try disabling particles in options

### Getting Help
1. Check the `docs/` folder for detailed documentation
2. Review `logs/` for error messages
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed via `launch_game.bat`
