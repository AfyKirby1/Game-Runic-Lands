# Phase 3: Critical Bug Fixes - Runic Lands

## üéØ **Objective**
Fix critical visual and gameplay issues identified during testing:
- Ground/world rendering problems
- Missing world borders
- Camera system not following player properly
- Player disappearing at world edges
- Broken inventory system

## üêõ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Graphics Engine Integration**
**Problem**: Main game loop was bypassing the Synapstex graphics engine's camera system
- Manual drawing in `main.py` without proper camera offset
- World and player drawn separately instead of using render layers

**Solution**: 
- Modified `main.py` draw method to use `graphics.render_all(screen)`
- Proper integration with render layers and camera system
- World and entities now rendered through graphics engine

### 2. **World Border Visualization**
**Problem**: No visible world boundaries, players could disappear at edges
- World had logical boundaries but no visual indicators
- Players could move to edge and become invisible

**Solution**:
- Added bold black border lines (4px thick) around world edges
- Borders drawn with camera offset for proper positioning
- Only draw borders when they're visible on screen (culling)

### 3. **Player Boundary Collision**
**Problem**: Player could move to exact world edge and disappear
- Bounds checking allowed player to reach 0,0 coordinates
- No padding from world borders

**Solution**:
- Added 8-pixel padding from world borders
- Improved bounds checking with `border_padding` system
- Player now stops before reaching visual borders

### 4. **Camera System**
**Problem**: Camera offset not properly applied to world rendering
- World drawing method had offset parameter but main.py wasn't using graphics engine
- Manual camera calculations in main.py conflicted with graphics engine

**Solution**:
- Removed manual camera handling from main.py
- Full integration with Synapstex graphics engine camera system
- Camera now properly follows player through `set_camera_target()`

### 5. **World Chunk Loading** ‚≠ê **NEW**
**Problem**: World terrain not rendering (showing gray background instead of grass)
- `update_chunks()` method existed but wasn't being called
- Player position not triggering chunk loading around them

**Solution**:
- Added `world.update_chunks()` call in main game loop
- Chunks now load properly around player position
- Grass terrain renders correctly with variations

### 6. **Menu Particle Bleeding** ‚≠ê **NEW**
**Problem**: Main menu particles continuing to show during gameplay
- Shared particle system between menu and game states
- No cleanup when transitioning between states

**Solution**:
- Clear particles when starting new game: `particle_system.particles.clear()`
- Clear particles when returning to menu
- Proper particle system bounds for game world

### 7. **Player Animation System** ‚≠ê **NEW**
**Problem**: Player character not animating during movement
- Animation state not updating based on movement
- Animation timer not advancing frames

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `player.update()` to handle animation states
- Proper animation frame cycling based on movement
- Sprite flipping for left/right facing directions

### 8. **Initial Chunk Loading** ‚≠ê **NEW**
**Problem**: Terrain not visible when game starts
- Chunks only loaded when player moves, not at startup
- Player spawns in empty gray area until first movement

**Solution**:
- Added initial chunk loading in `init_single_player()`
- Load chunks immediately around player spawn point
- Added debug logging to track chunk loading
- Ensure terrain is visible from game start

## üîß **Files Modified**

### `main.py`
- **draw()**: Replaced manual drawing with `graphics.render_all(screen)`
- **Pause state**: Now uses graphics engine for consistent rendering
- **Camera**: Removed duplicate camera logic, using graphics engine

### `systems/world.py` 
- **draw()**: Added world border rendering with bold black lines
- **Border culling**: Only draw borders when visible on screen
- **Border positioning**: Proper offset calculation for camera movement

### `entities/player.py`
- **move()**: Enhanced bounds checking with border padding
- **Position calculation**: Safer position updates before bounds checking
- **World boundaries**: Player stops 8 pixels from world border

## üéÆ **Expected Results**

1. **Visible World**: Ground terrain renders properly with camera following player
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Bold black lines show world edges at all times  
3. **Player Tracking**: Camera smoothly follows player movement
4. **No Disappearing**: Player stays visible and stops at world boundaries
5. **Consistent Rendering**: All game elements use unified graphics engine
