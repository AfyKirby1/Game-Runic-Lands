# ðŸŽ¯ Skill System Design

## Core Mechanics

### Skill Categories
```python
SKILL_TYPES = {
    "Combat": {
        "description": "Skills that improve combat effectiveness",
        "skills": [
            "Attack",      # Accuracy with weapons
            "Strength",    # Melee damage
            "Defense",     # Damage reduction
            "Magic",       # Spell damage and utility
            "Ranged",      # Projectile combat
            "Prayer"       # Combat buffs and abilities
        ]
    },
    "Gathering": {
        "description": "Skills for collecting raw resources",
        "skills": [
            "Mining",      # Ore collection
            "Woodcutting", # Tree harvesting
            "Fishing",     # Fish catching
            "Farming",     # Crop growing
            "Hunting"      # Animal trapping
        ]
    },
    "Production": {
        "description": "Skills for creating items from resources",
        "skills": [
            "Smithing",    # Metal working
            "Crafting",    # General item creation
            "Fletching",   # Bow and arrow making
            "Cooking",     # Food preparation
            "Alchemy"      # Potion brewing
        ]
    },
    "Utility": {
        "description": "Skills that enhance gameplay mechanics",
        "skills": [
            "Agility",     # Movement abilities
            "Flying",      # Mount mastery
            "Thieving",    # Stealth and pickpocketing
            "Construction" # Building and decoration
        ]
    }
}
```

### Experience System
```python
class SkillSystem:
    def calculate_exp_for_level(self, level: int) -> int:
        """OSRS-style exponential scaling"""
        base = 100
        multiplier = 1.1
        return int(base * (multiplier ** level))
    
    def calculate_level_from_exp(self, exp: int) -> int:
        """Reverse calculation to find level from exp"""
        pass
    
    def award_experience(self, skill: str, base_exp: float) -> float:
        modifiers = {
            "equipment_bonus": 1.0,
            "event_bonus": 1.0,
            "party_bonus": 1.0,
            "chain_bonus": 1.0
        }
        return base_exp * product(modifiers.values())
```

### Skill Interactions
```python
SKILL_CHAINS = {
    "Basic": [
        ("Woodcutting", "Logs"),
        ("Fletching", "Bow"),
        ("Ranged", "Combat")
    ],
    "Cooking": [
        ("Fishing", "Raw Fish"),
        ("Cooking", "Cooked Food"),
        ("Combat", "Health Restore")
    ],
    "Crafting": [
        ("Mining", "Ore"),
        ("Smithing", "Equipment"),
        ("Combat", "Power Increase")
    ]
}
```

## Progression Systems

### Resource Gathering
- Tool tiers affect gathering speed
- Resource nodes have different difficulties
- Rare resource chances increase with level
- Special resource spots for higher levels

### Production Skills
```python
class ProductionRecipe:
    name: str
    required_level: int
    materials: Dict[str, int]
    exp_reward: float
    failure_rate: float  # Decreases with level
    
    def calculate_success_chance(self, player_level: int) -> float:
        base = 0.5
        level_bonus = (player_level - self.required_level) * 0.05
        return min(0.95, base + level_bonus)
```

### Skill Mastery
```python
class SkillMastery:
    level: int
    experience: float
    perks: List[str]
    achievements: List[str]
    
    def unlock_perk(self, level: int) -> str:
        """Unlock special abilities at milestone levels"""
        pass
```

## Experience Bonuses

### Base Modifiers
- Equipment bonus: +5-25% based on quality
- Event bonus: +50% during special events
- Party bonus: +10% per nearby player
- Chain bonus: +5% for consecutive actions

### Special Events
```python
class SkillEvent:
    name: str
    duration: timedelta
    affected_skills: List[str]
    exp_multiplier: float
    special_rewards: List[str]
```

## Integration with Combat

### Combat Benefits
- Higher crafting = Better equipment
- Higher cooking = Better healing items
- Higher agility = Dodge chance
- Higher flying = Mount abilities

### Resource Benefits
- Higher combat = Access to dangerous resource areas
- Higher defense = Survive in hazardous gathering zones
- Higher magic = Teleport to resource locations

## Skill-Specific Features

### Gathering
```python
class ResourceNode:
    type: str
    difficulty: int
    base_exp: float
    respawn_time: float
    rare_drop_chance: float
    
    def calculate_harvest_time(self, player_level: int, tool_tier: int) -> float:
        base_time = 3.0  # seconds
        level_reduction = player_level * 0.02
        tool_reduction = tool_tier * 0.15
        return max(0.5, base_time - level_reduction - tool_reduction)
```

### Production
```python
class CraftingStation:
    type: str
    available_recipes: List[str]
    level_requirement: int
    special_bonuses: Dict[str, float]
```

### Utility
```python
class UtilityAbility:
    name: str
    level_requirement: int
    cooldown: float
    effect_duration: float
    
    def calculate_effect_strength(self, player_level: int) -> float:
        base_power = 1.0
        level_bonus = (player_level - self.level_requirement) * 0.03
        return base_power + level_bonus
```
