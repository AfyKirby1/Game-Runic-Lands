- **Graphics**: Custom Synapstex Graphics Engine (built on Pygame)
- **Audio**: Seamless music system with 10-section looping
- **Architecture**: Modular system design with clean separation
- **Platform**: Windows (with cross-platform foundation)

## 🎨 **Synapstex Graphics Engine**

### **Key Features**
The custom-built graphics engine includes:
- **Particle Systems**: [10 different autumn leaf colors, fireflies, stars, sparkles][[memory:8675283471829075195]]
- **Render Layers**: Depth-sorted drawing with optimization
- **Camera System**: Smooth player tracking with world boundaries
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Dynamic lighting with celestial body movement
- **Performance Optimization**: Culling, caching, and efficient algorithms

### **Particle System Details**
- **Autumn Leaves**: Forest green, dark orange, orange, red-orange, crimson red, gold/yellow, dark golden rod, saddle brown, tomato red
- **Emission Pattern**: Every 3 seconds with 2-4 leaves per emission, 15 initial leaves
- **World/Screen Space**: Supports both world-space and screen-space particles

---

## 🎵 **Audio System**

### **Seamless Music Implementation**
The music system uses [seamless looping with pygame events][[memory:7044340083287372970]]:

1. **`start_seamless_menu_music()`** - Loads first section and builds queue of all 10 sections
2. **`pygame.USEREVENT + 1`** - Event triggered when track ends
3. **`handle_music_event()`** - Automatically plays next queued track
4. **Infinite Looping** - When queue empties, system restarts sequence

### **Music Files**
- **Menu Music**: menu_section1.wav through menu_section10.wav
- **Game Music**: game_section1.wav through game_section10.wav
- **Sound Effects**: attack.wav, menu_click.wav, menu_select.wav
