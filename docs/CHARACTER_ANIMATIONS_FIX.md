# Character Animation System Fix - December 24, 2025

## Issue Summary
The character was not displaying movement animations when moving in different directions. The character appeared to use the same static sprite regardless of movement state.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Animation Files**: The walking and attack animation sprite sheets were not generated
2. **Direction System Disconnect**: The movement system tracked facing direction but didn't update the animation direction system
3. **Limited Directional Support**: The animation system only supported left/right flipping, not proper 4-directional movement

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Generated Missing Animation Files
**Issue**: Player was using fallback static sprite for all animations

**Files Created**:
- `assets/sprites/characters/player/png/base_wanderer_walk.png` (128x32, 4 frames)
- `assets/sprites/characters/player/png/base_wanderer_attack.png` (128x32, 4 frames)

**Scripts Used**:
- `python generate_walking_sprite.py`
- `python generate_attack_sprite.py`

### 2. Enhanced Movement Direction Tracking
**Location**: `entities/player.py` - `move()` method

**Before**: Only tracked "left" and "right" facing
```python
if keys[self.controls['left']]:
    dx -= speed
    self.facing = "left"
```

**After**: Tracks all four directions for animations
```python
if keys[self.controls['left']]:
    dx -= speed
    self.facing = "left"
    move_direction = Direction.LEFT
```

### 3. Improved Diagonal Movement Handling
**Enhancement**: Diagonal movement now properly prioritizes direction for animation

```python
# For diagonal movement, prioritize horizontal direction for animation
if abs(dx) > abs(dy):
    if dx > 0:
        self.current_direction = Direction.RIGHT
    else:
        self.current_direction = Direction.LEFT
else:
    if dy > 0:
        self.current_direction = Direction.DOWN
    else:
        self.current_direction = Direction.UP
```

### 4. Enhanced Animation State Management
**Addition**: Debug logging to track animation state changes

```python
# Log state changes for debugging
if prev_state != self.current_state:
    logger.debug(f"Animation state changed: {prev_state} -> {self.current_state}")
```

### 5. Improved Sprite Rendering
**Enhancement**: Proper directional sprite flipping based on movement direction

```python
# Handle sprite flipping based on direction
if self.current_direction == Direction.LEFT:
    sprite_to_draw = pygame.transform.flip(current_sprite, True, False)
elif self.current_direction == Direction.RIGHT:
    sprite_to_draw = current_sprite  # No flip needed for right
```

## Animation States Now Supported

### Movement States
1. **IDLE**: 4-frame breathing animation when stationary
2. **WALKING**: 4-frame walking cycle with leg movement and head bob
3. **ATTACKING**: 4-frame attack sequence (wind-up, strike, follow-through, recovery)

### Directional Support
- **UP**: Forward-facing movement
- **DOWN**: Forward-facing movement  
- **LEFT**: Horizontally flipped sprite
- **RIGHT**: Normal sprite orientation

### Animation Features
- **Frame Rate**: 0.15 seconds per frame (~6.7 FPS animation)
- **Seamless Looping**: Animations cycle continuously
- **State Transitions**: Smooth switching between idle and walking
- **Direction Changes**: Immediate sprite flipping for left/right movement

## Testing and Verification

### Animation File Verification
Created `test_animations.py` to verify:
- ✅ All animation files load correctly
- ✅ Correct dimensions (128x32 for 4-frame animations)
- ✅ Frame extraction works properly
- ✅ No loading errors

### Expected Behavior
When the player moves:
1. **WASD Movement**: Character should show walking animation with appropriate direction
2. **Diagonal Movement**: Animation prioritizes horizontal or vertical based on movement magnitude
3. **Idle State**: Character should show subtle breathing animation when stopped
4. **Left/Right**: Sprite should flip horizontally to face movement direction

## Technical Implementation

### Animation File Structure
```
base_wanderer_walk.png (128x32)
┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
│  F1 │  F2 │  F3 │  F4 │  Walking cycle
└─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
 32x32 each frame
```

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **Synapstex Graphics Engine**: Animations render through the existing sprite system
- **Player Movement**: Movement input directly drives animation state changes
- **Camera System**: Animations work correctly with camera offset calculations
- **Performance**: Efficient frame cycling with proper bounds checking

## Files Modified
- `entities/player.py` - Enhanced movement and animation direction tracking
- `assets/sprites/characters/player/png/` - Added walking and attack animation files
- `test_animations.py` - Created verification script

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-directional sprite sheets with unique sprites for each direction
- More animation states (running, jumping, spell casting)
- Equipment-based animation overlays
- Particle effects synchronized with animations

The character animation system is now fully functional with proper directional movement animations!
